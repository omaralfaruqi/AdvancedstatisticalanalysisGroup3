# Introduction

These practical will be using dataset that contains information on 900 children from 30 different schools across Scotland. The data was collected as part of a study looking at whether education-related motivation is associated with school grades. This is expected to be different for state vs privately funded schools. All children completed an ‘education motivation’ questionnaire, and their end-of-year grade average has been recorded.

Datasets contains: variable motiv : Child's Education Motivation score range ( range 1-10) funding : Funding( 'state' or 'private') schoolid : Name of School that the childs attends grade : Child's end-of-year grdae average ( 0-100)

Children are nested within schools. This means : Level 1 : students ( motiv) Level 2 : Schoolid

    geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

end of year grade increases as the motivational score in both groups, however, the grade score for private funded school slightly higher.

# Comparing groups using multilevel model

We are starting with simplest model( null model) .

score\_{ij} = \beta\*0 + u\*{0j} + e\_{ij}

1.  grade-{ij} : the child's end fo year grade
2.  b_0 : the overal mean grade across school
3.  u\_{0j} : the effect pf school , on grade . This is also level 2 residuals
4.  e\_{if} : student-level residuals, This is level 1 residuals

## Single level analysis

```{r}
schoolgrade1 <- lm(grade ~ 1, data = schoolgrade)
summary(schoolgrade1)
```

## Multi-level analysis

Using the null model ( no explanatory variables). we will set the estimation using maximum likelyhood estimates ( MLE) The random effect due to the school

```{r}
schoolgrade2 <- lmer(grade ~ 1 + (1 | schoolid), 
       data = schoolgrade, REML = FALSE)
summary(schoolgrade2)
```

The overall mean attainment (across schools) is estimated as 50.35. The mean for school 𝑗 is estimated as 50.35+𝑈̂0𝑗 where 𝑈̂0𝑗 is the school residuals (Level-2 residuals)

The intraclass correlation ( ICC) is 44.74/(44.76 + 165.63) = 0.212, which is 21%, explaining 21% of difference of variablitty of variance.

```{r}
tidy(schoolgrade2) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Comparing the models ( schoolgrade1 vs schoolgrade2) . Does the multilevel model differ from the single linear regression model? Hence, we compare with Likelyhood Ratio Test

```{r}
logLik(schoolgrade1) ; logLik(schoolgrade2)
```

Likelyhood Ratio Test : 2×(−3609.568−(−3684.077)) = 2(74.509) , that is 149.018

The more complex model (schoolgrade2) fits significantly better than the simpler model (schoolgrade1).

variance : There are 2 variances level 2: 44.76 level 1: 165.63

Hence ICC : 0.12 This indicates that 21% of the variance in score attainment can be attributed to the differences between schools.

# Random intercept models

## Adding an explanatory variable

we will model the effecr of a student-level variable funding in the model.

grade\_{ij} = \beta\*0 +\* \beta\*1motiv\*{ij} + u{0j} + e\_{ij}

```{r}
schoolgrade.ri <- lmer(grade ~ motiv + (1 | schoolid), 
           data = schoolgrade, 
           REML = FALSE)
summary(schoolgrade.ri)
```

```{r}
tidy(schoolgrade.ri, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  kbl %>%
  kable_styling()
```

The equation for the average fitted regression line (across school) is

grade\_{ij} = 50.35 + 4.459motiv\_{ij}

Because this is a random intercept model, the intercepts differ. But, the slope is fixed at 4.459.

# Prediction

We can predict the grade attainment based on the mixed model for each student. The prediction is the average fitted regression (average grade) plus the school’s intercept.

This is equal to the average fitted regression line plus the relevant school’s intercept.

```{r}
pred_score.ri <- fitted(schoolgrade.ri)
head(pred_score.ri, 10)
```

The random effects (due to random intercepts) due to school are :

```{r}
schoolgrade.rand_ef <- ranef(schoolgrade.ri)
head(schoolgrade.rand_ef$schoolid, 20)
```

fitted values ( using broom.mixed::augment())

```{r}
schoolgrade.ri_fitted <- augment(schoolgrade.ri)
```

```{r}
schoolgrade.ri_fitted %>% 
  slice(1:20)
```

## manual calculation

The grade attainment for students from schoolid = 1st observation,where nested school : Kilsyth Academy, motivation score : 7.74

the intercept = 28.86 level-2 residual (school level residual) = -12.06

grade\_{ij} = \beta\*0 +\* \beta\*1motiv\*{ij} + u{0j} + e\_{ij} grade\_{ij} = 28.865023 + 4.459075\*(7.74) + (-12.6060734)

```{r}
28.865023 + 4.459075*(7.74) + (-12.6060734) 
```

## Plot

```{r}
ggplot(schoolgrade.ri_fitted, aes(motiv, .fitted, group = schoolid )) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  ylab('fitted grade attainment') +
  xlab('motivation score') +
  ggtitle('The fitted value for random intercept model with covariate motiv') +
  theme_bw()
```

## Variance

## Between school variance

in the constant only model the variance is 44.76 then the variance increased after adding motiv where model with motiv as the explanatory variable now has the variance of 73.97

After accounting for motivation score effects, the proportion of unexplained variance that is due to differences between schools increases to 73.97/(73.97+143.52) = 34%

```{r}
73.97/(73.97+143.52)
```

## Within school variance

also note that

constant only model variance is 165.63 reduction of variance after adding motiv model with motivation score as the explanatory variable 143.52

we can see that the addition of motivation score has increased the amount of variance at both the school and the student level. The between-school variance has increased from 44.76 to 73.97, and the within-school variance has reduced from 165.63 to 143.52. Motivation score variable reduces unexplained variance at the student level, in addition , effect of between-variance becomes more prominent. Motivation score is an important individual-level predictor. It helps explain why students within the same school differ, and at the same time, it reveals stronger differences between schools once the within-school variation is accounted for.

# Random slope model

Random slope model allows different slope. We will now extend the random intercept model fitted before to allow both the intercept and the slope to vary randomly across schools.

## Model

grade\_{ij} = \beta\*0 +\* \beta\*1motiv\*{ij} + u{0j} + u\_{1j}motiv\_{ij} + e\_{ij}

```{r}
schoolgrade.rs <- lmer(grade ~ motiv + (1 + motiv | schoolid), 
           data = schoolgrade, REML = FALSE)
```

```{r}
summary(schoolgrade.rs)
```

The variable remain significance in random slope model

```{r}
tidy(schoolgrade.rs) %>% kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

The fitted (average) score attainment based on the random slope model

```{r}
schoolgrade.rs_fitted <- augment(schoolgrade.rs)
head(schoolgrade.rs_fitted, 20)
```

the average school we predict an increase of 4.465 points in the attainment score for motivation score 0.

# Comparing model between random intercepts and random slope

```{r}
anova(schoolgrade.ri, schoolgrade.rs)
```

There is very strong evidence that the motivation score effect differs across schools

# Interpretation of random effects accross school

The motivation score effect for school 𝑗 is estimated as 4.465 + 𝑈̂\_{1𝑗}, and the between-school variance in these slopes is estimated as 3.905.

For the average school we predict an increase of 4.465 points in the grade score for each successive cohort. A 95% coverage interval for the school slopes is estimated as 4.465±1.96 √3.905 = 0.59 to 8.33

Thus, assuming a normal distribution, we would expect the middle 95% of schools to have a slope between 0.59 to 8.33

# Prediction for random slope

```{r}
schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs <- ranef(schoolgrade.rs, condVar = TRUE)
datatable(schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs$schoolid)

```




## Plot of random effect

School slope vs school intercept 𝑢0𝑗 and 𝑢1𝑗

```{r}
plot(schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs)
```

```{r}
schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs.sc <- schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs$schoolid 
names(schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs.sc)
```

using ggplot2

```{r}
schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs.sc <- schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs.sc %>%
  rename(rs_slope = motiv, rs_int = "(Intercept)")

schoolgrade.ra.eff.rs.sc %>% 
ggplot(aes( x = rs_int, y = rs_slope)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

# Model

\widehat{grade}*{ij} = (29.260 +* \hat{u_{0j}}) + (4.465 + \hat{u_{1j}})motiv{ij}

# Plot the fitted values from random slope

```{r}
datatable(schoolgrade.rs_fitted)
```

```{r}
schoolgrade.rs_fitted %>%
  ggplot(aes(motiv, .fitted, group = schoolid)) +  
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = schoolid), alpha = 0.3) +
  ylab('The fitted grade attainment') +
  xlab('motivation score') +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle('The fitted grade attainment for each student against year from random slope model')
```

## Adding a level-2 explanatory variable to the random slope model

Funding comes in as fixed effect in the model

```{r}
schoolgrade.rs_funding <- lmer(grade ~ motiv + funding +
                     (1 + motiv | schoolid), data = schoolgrade,
                     REML = FALSE, lmerControl(optimizer = 'bobyqa'))
                      
summary(schoolgrade.rs_funding)
```

```{r}
anova(schoolgrade.rs,schoolgrade.rs_funding)
```

fundingstate added in the model :schoolgrade.rs_funding. however, results shows covariates is not significant when included in the model. Model comparison is also not significant.thus, the simpler model is chosen.

## Checking Interactions in the random slop model

Inview of adding covariate funding doest not show significant value, we will not proceed with interaction. model comparison also did not increase fitting in the model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final model :

```{r}
m.schoolgrade <- lmer(grade ~ motiv +
                     (1 + motiv | schoolid), data = schoolgrade,
                     REML = FALSE, lmerControl(optimizer = 'bobyqa'))
                      
summary(m.schoolgrade)
```

## Checking Assumptions

```{r}
res.m.schoolgrade <- augment(m.schoolgrade)
datatable(res.m.schoolgrade)
```

## Plot random effect

## Plot 1

```{r}
library(merTools)
```

```{r}
res.m.schoolgrade.plot <- REsim(m.schoolgrade)
plotREsim(res.m.schoolgrade.plot)
```

Plot 2 suing lattice package

```{r}
library(lattice)
randoms <- ranef(m.schoolgrade , condVar = TRUE)
dotplot(randoms)
```

Schools with intercepts further to the right have higher baseline values, while those further to the left have lower baseline values. For example, Stewart Academy has a relatively high intercept compared to Balwearie High School, which has a much lower (negative) intercept. School-specific differences: There is clear variability in the intercepts across different schools, indicating that some schools have generally higher or lower baseline outcomes than others. Effect of "motiv": The "motiv" variable generally appears to have a positive relationship with the outcome across most schools, and this effect seems to be relatively consistent in its direction, although there might be some minor variations in magnitude.
